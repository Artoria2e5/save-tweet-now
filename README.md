# ArchiveWeb.page Express

ArchiveWeb.page Express offers high-fidelity web archiving directly in the browser!
It provides a more streamlined version of ArchiveWeb.page system without requiring a custom extension or desktop app.

AWP Express is designed for archiving public websites only.

It includes an option to download a WACZ file or upload a WACZ file to Filecoin/IPFS using web3.storage

With version 0.2.0, the system also includes an experimental simple crawl option for visiting all links on a page automatically.

The system uses a Cloudflare worker as a proxy to archive despite CORS restrictions.
